# SDL Series
The purpose of this repository is to keep saving my SDL game development skills over the past time, you are going to find some really simple (maybe bugged) games here. Enjoy!

## What you need to know
Here I use SDL which is a third-party graphics library writing in C to work with windows and 2D graphics.
the include files and libs can be found in the SDL folder, SDL_image is also available there.
<br>
<br>
Except for the SDL folder, every directory is an independent game built with CMake Software. The executable is inside build folders
and should not be moved from there
<br>
<br>
Every game were made with C++
